Here is the completed code exercise in React, Typescript, and Material UI. I made sure to make it as user-friendly as possible:

- The text box is selected from the start so that you can start typing without having to click it
- Pressing the enter key adds the task so you don’t need to click the button and returns focus to the text box so that you can start typing the next one
- Clicking the “Add task” button returns focus to the text box too
- Trying to add an empty task prompts you to enter text for it
- Tasks are added to the top so your most recent ones are most visible and you can see the result of adding one right away
- Default due date is 1 week ahead

My extra feature is storing your tasks in the browser so that coming back to the page leaves you where you left off instead of clearing all your tasks
